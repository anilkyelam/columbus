\section{Measurement Study}
\label{sec:study}

%Our goal in developing this technique is to demonstrate how easy it is for
%attackers to exploit the pervasive memory bus covert channel and obtain
%co-residency information, thereby motivating the need to address it. This
%information can be used by attackers in aiding a lot of attack scenarios
%\todo{for example?} or simply learn the internal mechanisms of a cloud. 
%In the section, we explore some ways in
%which the tool can be used to gain some insights into lambda activity in some
%AWS regions.  

In this section, we present a variety of measurements on serverless function
density on AWS using our co-residence detector, and the factors that may affect
this density. As we discussed earlier, the key challenge in enabling traditional
covert channels on the cloud is placingthe sender and receiver on the same
machine. So we attempt to answer the following question: Assuming that the user
launches a number of (sender and receiver) lambdas at a specific point in time,
what is the expected number of such co-resident pairs that they might see? We
deploy a large number of lambdas on various AWS regions and report the
co-residence density -- that is, the average number of lambdas that end up
co-resident on each server.  The higher the co-residence density, the easier it
is for the user to ultimately establish covert channels with lambdas. Unless
specified otherwise, all the experiments are performed with 1.5 GB lambdas and
executed successfully with \textbf{zero error} in co-residence detection.

    lambdas, where 500 lambdas are launched from each account. The uniformity of
    the split indicates that the lambda scheduler might be invariant to the
    account the lambdas are launched from. Similar results are shown for
    different lambda sizes in the right plot. }

\subsection{Across AWS regions}
We execute our co-residence detector with 1000 1.5 GB Lambdas in various AWS
regions. Figure~\ref{fig:awsregions} comprises multiple plots depicting
the co-resident groups per region, with each bar indicating the fraction of
lambdas that detected a certain number of neighbors (i.e., that belong to a
co-resident group of a certain size). Plots that skew to the right indicate a
higher co-residence density when compared to the plots skewed to the left (also
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:density}). We note that, in most regions, almost
all lambdas recognize at least one neighbor (indicated by smaller or
non-existent first bar in each plot). We hypothesize that the co-residence
density is (inversely) dependent on the total number of servers and the lambda
activity in the region, both of which can be assumed to be lower in newer AWS
regions, hence the higher co-residence density in those regions as we can see in
Figure~\ref{fig:density}. The ample co-residence in general across all the
regions shows that lambdas provide a fertile ground for covert channel attacks.
%We note that the largest co-resident group on a single machine was comprised of 25 lambdas. 


\subsection{Other factors}
We also examine how co-residence is affected by various launch strategies that
the user may use, like deploying lambdas from multiple AWS accounts and
different lambda sizes. In particular, we wish to determine if we our mechanism
exhibits different results when: 1) the user deploys sender lambdas and receiver
lambdas on two separate accounts (normally the case with covert channels) and 2)
the senders and receivers are created with different lambdas sizes.  To answer
these questions, we run an experiment with 1000 lambdas of which we launch 500
lambdas from one account (senders) and 500 from other deployed in a random
order. The co-residence observed was comparable to the case where all the
lambdas were launched from one account. In the left subfigure of
Figure~\ref{fig:factors}, we show the breakdown of co-resident group of lambdas
of each size among the two accounts.  We can see that among the co-resident
groups of all sizes, roughly half of lambdas came from either account. This show
that lambda scheduler is agnostic to the accounts the lambdas were launched
from. We see similar results for different lambda sizes, as shown in the right
subfigure of Figure~\ref{fig:factors}.

%From our experiments, we also observe that co-residence density in a region
%barely changes during course of the day or the week (data not shown
%in any figure \todo{is this okay?}).  This gives the user the freedom to utilize this
%technique at any time and expect similar results.
