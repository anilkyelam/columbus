Cloud computing has seen explosive growth and popularity, especially
``serverless'' service modalities, such as AWS lambdas. These services are
lighter-weight and provide more flexibility in scheduling and cost, which
contributes to their popularity, however the security issues associated with
serverless computing is not well understood. In this work, we construct a covert
channel, a means of transmitting data outside of tranditional channels, that is
practical for AWS lambdas.  We extend the work in Wu et. al to utilize the
memory-bus to develop a co-residence detector that is generic, reliable, and
scalable.  This technique performs dynamic neighbor discovery and is incredibly
fast, executing in a matter of seconds. In addition to this protocol for lambda
co-residence detection, we also perform and evaluate a series of measurements
that exemplify the practicality of this approach in a cloud setting. Through
this work, we show that efforts to secure co-residency detection in cloud
providers is not yet complete.

%Cloud computing has seen explosive growth in the past decade. While
%efficient sharing of the underlying server infrastructure among tenants 
%has contributed to this growth, the same principles also open avenues for 
%cross-tenant attacks. Providers like AWS and Azure have 
%traditionally relied on obfuscation of coresidency information 
%to prevent such attacks. However, recent works have repeatedly found
%covert channels that allow for breaking this encapsulation and detecting
%co-residency, prompting the providers to harden isolation on their platforms. 
%In this work, we find yet another such technique for detecting coresidency of 
%cloud instances. Our technique uses a hardware covert channel based on the 
%memory bus, which is more pervasive and harder to fix. 
%We show that this channel can be used to perform reliable co-residence detection 
%% reliable and fast go against each other. just doing reliable is easy, as you can 
%% get 100% reliability by letting it run forever. The challenge is to have 
%% something that is fast and yet reliable. I don't know how to convey that nicely 
%one that is fast enough for detecting coresidency for the ephemeral serverless functions,
%or lambdas. We use our technique to perform co-operative co-residence detection 
%for thousands of AWS lambdas within a few seconds, which could aid attackers in 
%performing DDoS attacks or learn cloud's internal mechanisms. 
%In this paper, we present the technique in detail, evaluate it, 
%and use it to perform a measurement study on
%lambda activity across AWS regions.  Through this work, we hope to motivate the
%need to address this covert channel.
