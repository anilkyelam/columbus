%% The "title" command has an optional parameter,
%% allowing the author to define a "short title" to be used in page headers.
\title[Covert Communication In The Cloud With Lambdas]
{CoResident Evil: Covert Communication In The Cloud With Lambdas} % 
%% The word "Enabling" because this work is not centered around building covert channel 
%% and estimating capacity, etc rather it is focused on co-residence detection, a 
%% key missing piece that stopped existing covert channel work to be extended to lambdas...

%%
%% The "author" command and its associated commands are used to define
%% the authors and their affiliations.
%% Of note is the shared affiliation of the first two authors, and the
%% "authornote" and "authornotemark" commands
%% used to denote shared contribution to the research.
