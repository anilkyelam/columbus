What are the limitations of the technique? What can an attacker 
do with this colocation information? How can AWS prevent this? 
Something about firecracker? Helps performance isolation 
studies such as \cite{wangusenix2018}.
This technique can be used with other containers 
like VMs. While the co-operative coresidence detection itself 
does not directly help attackers locate their victims, it can 
help attackers perform highly sophisticated DDOS attacks once 
they did find the victim.
