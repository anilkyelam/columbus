What are some hypothetical usecases?
- Frameworks like gg can use our tool as locality indicator to place 
take advantage of locality in burst workloads. 
- the precise information can be used by attacker to gain wider 
attack area and turn off other instances to make attacks cost-effective
- While the co-operative coresidence detection itself 
does not directly help attackers locate their victims, it can 
help attackers perform highly sophisticated DDOS attacks once 
they did find the victim. e.g., power surge attacks?
- as previous host based approach like /procfs info do not work anymore,
papers like "peeking .." cannot perform tenant isolation and other such 
studies that require precise colocation information. i.e., Helps performance isolation 
studies such as \cite{wangusenix2018}.

What are some limitations of the technique?


How can clouds prevent this?
