\section{Background \& Motivation}
\label{sec:background}

We begin with a brief background on relevant topics as we motivate 
the need for fast and scalable co-residence detection in
enabling covert channels with lambdas.


\subsection{Lambdas/Serverless Functions} 
\label{sec:background:lambdas}

We focus on serverless functions in this paper, as they are one of the
fastest-growing cloud services and are less well-studied from a security 
standpoint. Offered as lambdas on
AWS~\cite{awslambda}, and cloud functions on GCP~\cite{gcpfunctions} and 
Azure~\cite{azurefunctions}, these functions are of interest because they do 
not require the developer
to provision, maintain, or administer servers. In addition to this low overhead,
lambdas are much more cost-efficient than virtual machines (VMs) as they allow
more efficient packing of functions on servers. Lambdas execute as much smaller
units than containers and virtual machines, and are more ephemeral. 
For example, on AWS, the memory 
of lambdas is capped at 3 GB, with a maximum execution limit of 15 minutes. 
As with other cloud services, the user has no control over the physical location
of the server(s) on which their lambdas are spawned.

While lambdas are limited in the computations they can execute (typically 
written in high-level languages like Python, C\#, etc), 
they are conversely incredibly lightweight and
can be initiated and deleted in a very short amount of time. Cloud providers 
run lambdas in dedicated containers with limited resources (e.g., Firecracker
~\cite{firecracker}), which are usually cached and re-used for future lambdas 
to mitigate cold-start latencies~\cite{awscontainerreuse}. The ephemeral nature of serverless
functions and their limited flexibility increases the difficulty in detecting 
co-residency, as we will discuss later. Previous studies that profiled 
lambdas~\cite{wangusenix2018} focused on the performance aspects like 
cold start latencies, function instance lifetime, CPU usage, etc. 
across various clouds, while the security aspects remain relatively understudied.


\subsection{Covert Channels in the Cloud}
\label{sec:background:covertchannels}
In our attempt to shed light on the security aspects of lambdas, we focus 
particularly on the feasiblity of establishing a reliable covert channel 
in the cloud using lambdas. 
Covert channels enable a means of transmitting information beween entities 
that bypasses traditional monitoring or auditing. Typically, this is acheived 
by communicating data across unintended channels such as signalling bits by 
causing contention on shared hardware media on the server~\cite{L2cacheCovertChannels,
ProcessorCovertChannels,ThermalCovertChannel,SshOverCovertChannel,wuusenix2012}. 
Past work has demonstrated covert channels in virtualized environments like 
the clouds using various harware such as caches~\cite{ristenpartccs2009,L2cacheCovertChannels},
memory bus~\cite{wuusenix2012}, and even processor temperature~\cite{ThermalCovertChannel}. \\

\noindent \textbf{Memory bus covert channel} 
Of particular interest to this work is the covert channel based on memory bus 
hardware introduced by Wu et al.~\cite{wuusenix2012}. 
In x86 systems, atomic memory instructions designed to facilitate 
multi-processor synchronization are supported by cache coherence protocols as
long as the operands stay within a cache line (generally the case as language
compilers make sure that operands are aligned). However, if the operand is
spread across two cache lines (referred to as "exotic" memory operations), x86
hardware achieves atomicity by locking the memory bus to prevent any other
memory access operations until the current operation finishes. This results in
significantly higher latencies for such locking operations compared to traditional 
memory accesses. As a result, a few consecutive locking operations could cause 
contention on the memory bus that could be exploited for covert communication.
Wu et al. acheived a data rate of 700 bps on the memory bus channel in an 
ideal laboratory setup.

Cloud environments, however, pose challenges to both establishing  
such covert channels and using them at their ideal performance. First, in the 
cloud setting, the sender and receiver entities are not known to be on the same server 
as this (coresidency) information is hidden from the tenants (even if the entities belong to 
the same tenant). Second, clouds present a virtualized platform that affects 
the communication on the covert channel as it introduces scheduling uncertainties
between the participating entities and interference from other non-partiticpating 
workloads. While studies generally deal with the latter problem by employing 
traditional error correction techniques~\cite{wuusenix2012} to overcome errors, 
the former challenge of establishing the covert channel (by detecting coresidency) 
in the first place requires a co-residence detection mechansim which the 
attacker needs to employ to get the sender and receiver on the same machine. 


\subsection{Co-residence Detection}
\label{sec:background:pastwork}

%On previous work on colocation, past techniques and why those techniques would 
%not work anymore
Past research has used various strategies to achieve co-residency for demonstrating 
various covert channel attacks in the cloud. Typically, the attacker launches a 
large number of cloud instances (VMs, Containers, etc.) following a certain 
launch strategy and employs a co-residence detection mechanism for detecting if
any pair of those instances are running on the same machine. 
Traditionally, the co-residence detection was done based on software runtime information 
like public/internal IP addresses~\cite{ristenpartccs2009}, files in \textit{procfs} 
or other environment variables~\cite{wangusenix2018,wuusenix2012} and other such logical
side-channels~\cite{varad191016,vmplacement} that two instances running on a same
server might share.

As virtualization platforms move towards stronger isolation between instances
(e.g. AWS' Firecracker VM~\cite{firecracker}), these logical covert-channels
have become less effective or infeasible. Furthermore, some of these
channels were only effective on container-based platforms that shared the
underlying OS image and were thus less suitable for hypervisor-based platforms.
This prompted a move towards using hardware-based covert channels, such as the 
ones discussed in the earlier section, which can bypass software isolation and 
are usually harder to fix. For example, Varadarajan et al.~\cite{varadarajan2015}
uses the memory bus covert channel to detect co-residency for EC2 instances. 
However, as we will show, traditional approaches do not extend well to lambdas 
as they are too slow or are not scalable. Thus, we set forth to determine a 
fast and scalable co-residence detection for lambdas.
