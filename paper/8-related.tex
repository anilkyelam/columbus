\textbf{Cloud Attacks} 
Co-residency is possible because of covert channels, so we begin our related
work with an investigation into cloud attacks. Initial
papers in co-residency detection utilized host information and network
addresses arising due to imperfect virtualization~\cite{ristenpartccs2009}.
However, these channels are now obsolete, as cloud provides have
strengthened virtualization and introduced Virtual Private
Clouds~\cite{awsvpc}. Later work used cache-based channels in various levels of
the cache~\cite{xuccsw2011, zhangccs2014, liu2015, kaylaap2016} and hardware
based channels like thermal covert channels~\cite{mastiusenix2015}, RNG
module~\cite{evtyushkinccs2016} and memory bus~\cite{wuusenix2012} have also
been explored in the recent past. Moreover, studies have found that VM
performance can be significantly degraded using memory DDoS
attacks~\cite{zhang2016memory}, while containers are susceptible to power
attacks from adjacent containers~\cite{gao2017}.  

Our work focuses on using the memory bus as a covert channel for determining
cooperative co-residency.  Covert channels using memory bus were first
introduced by Wu et. al~\cite{wuusenix2012}, and subsequently has been used for
co-residency detection on VMs and
containers~\cite{compstudycoresidency,varad191016}  Wu et. al~\cite{wuusenix2012}
introduced a new technique to lock the memory bus by using atomic memory
operations on addresses that fall on multiple cache lines, a technique we rely
on in our own work. \\

\textbf{Co-residency} 
One of the first pieces of literature in detecting VM co-residency was
introduced by Ristenpart et al., who demonstrated that VM co-residency detection
was possible and that these techniques could be used to gather information about
the victim machine (such as keystrokes and network
usage)~\cite{ristenpartccs2009}. This initial work was further expanded in
subsequent years to examine co-residency using memory bus
locking~\cite{xuusenix2015} and active traffic analysis~\cite{bates2012}, as
well as determining placement vulnerabilities in multi-tenant Public
Platform-as-a-Service systems~\cite{varadarajan2015, zhangpaas2016}. Finally,
Zhang et al. demonstrated a technique to detect VM co-residency detection via
side-channel analyses~\cite{zhang2011}. Our work expands on these previous works
by investigating co-residency for lambdas.\\

\textbf{Lambdas} 
While lambdas are a much newer technology than VMs, there still exists lterature
on the subject. Recent studies examined cost comparisons of running web
applications in the cloud on lambdas versus other
architectures~\cite{villamizar2016}, and also examined the lambdas have been
studied in the context of cost-effectivness of batching and data processing with
lambdas~\cite{kiran2015}.  Further research has shown how lambdas perform with
scalability and hardware isolation, indicating some flaws in the lambda
architecture~\cite{wangusenix2018}. From a security perspective, Izhikevich et.
al examined lambda co-residency using RNG and memory bus techniques (similar to
techniques utilized in VM co-residency)~\cite{izhikevich2018}. However, our work
differs from this study in that our technique informs the user of which lambdas
are on the same machine, not only that the lambdas experience co-residency.
